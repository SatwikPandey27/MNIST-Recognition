## MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project implements various machine learning algorithms to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It achieves an accuracy of approximately 96% using a combination of feature extraction and model selection techniques.

### Key Libraries Used:

* pandas: Data manipulation and processing
* numpy: Numerical computations
* matplotlib: Data visualization
* Scikit-learn: Machine learning models

### Methodology

**1. Data Extraction and Preprocessing:**

* Utilize pandas to load the MNIST dataset.
* Perform necessary preprocessing steps (e.g., normalization, reshaping) on images and labels using numpy.
* Consider including a visualization of sample images from the dataset using matplotlib.

**2. Binary Classification:**

* Implement a binary classifier (e.g., SGDClassifier) to distinguish between two specific digits.
* Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision and recall.

**3. Multiclass Classification:**

* Train and evaluate multiclass classification models (e.g., SVM, KNN) to classify all ten digits (0-9).
* Briefly explain the rationale behind choosing these specific algorithms.

**4. Feature Extraction and Grid Search:**

* Explore different feature extraction techniques (e.g., PCA, feature scaling) to improve model performance.
* Employ grid search to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration for feature extraction and model training.
* Briefly describe the feature extraction approaches and why they might be beneficial.

**5. Results and Discussion:**

* Report the final accuracy achieved after feature extraction and hyperparameter tuning.
* Discuss the impact of different algorithms, preprocessing steps, and feature extraction on model performance.
* Consider including visualizations of the confusion matrix or other performance metrics.

### Further Exploration

* Experiment with different deep learning architectures for potentially higher accuracy.
* Investigate techniques for handling imbalanced datasets if applicable.
* Explore methods for visualizing the learned features and decision boundaries.
